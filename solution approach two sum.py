In this question we were given a test case arraya and we had to find the numner in the array whoes sum resulted as the given number 
for ex - 

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

Now here we have 2 and 7 as the given number whose sum will give you the number 9.
So I have used the  brute force approach here where we take the first element which is 2 and add it with the other elements in the given array
so After that the algo will run till n-1 where it will check until it gets the number sum which is 9
